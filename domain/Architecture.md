# Architecture Overview for a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Platform

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview for building a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum network. It defines the key objects/models, their properties, interfaces, and relationships, serving as a definitive guide for technical implementation. The focus is on creating a clear and detailed prompt that can be used by AI models for code generation. Standards, approaches, and best practices are outlined to ensure the resulting implementation is clean, understandable, and adheres to industry norms.

## Architectural Layers

1. **Smart Contracts (On-Chain)**
   - Core functionality for token swapping, liquidity management, and governance.
2. **Backend Services (Off-Chain)**
   - Optional layer for data indexing, caching, and advanced features.
3. **Frontend Application**
   - User interface for interacting with the DEX.
